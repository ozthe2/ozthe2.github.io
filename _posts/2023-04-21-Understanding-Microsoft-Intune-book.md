I am excited to announce the release of my latest book, "Understanding Microsoft Intune: Deploying Applications Using PowerShell."

This comprehensive guide is the ultimate resource for anyone looking to master the art of application deployment using PowerShell scripts with Microsoft Intune. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced IT professional, this book covers everything you need to know to deploy simple and complex applications beyond the scope of default Intune application deployment scenarios and limitations.

Starting with PowerShell Cmdlets to get an understanding of deployment through PowerShell scripts, you will learn how to work with msiexec and run Setup.exe for installation and un-installation. You'll also discover how to use PowerShell to create detection rules, install a program by calling MSI or Setup.exe in Intune, and deploy scripts containing functions.

With detailed explanations and step-by-step instructions, this book will guide you through the entire process of application deployment in Intune. You'll also learn about deployment templates, application preparation in Intune, and how to create the .intunewin using the Intune content prep tool.

At the end of the book, you'll have gained a comprehensive understanding of application deployments and detection rules using PowerShell with Microsoft Intune.

"Understanding Microsoft Intune: Deploying Applications Using PowerShell" is available for purchase at all good book stores and online outlets. Don't miss out on the opportunity to take your application deployment skills to the next level. Get your copy today!
