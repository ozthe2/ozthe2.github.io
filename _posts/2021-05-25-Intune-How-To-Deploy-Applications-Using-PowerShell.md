I have a new book out: **Microsoft Intune - An Administrator's Guide to Deploying Applications using PowerShell**

There is a high-chance that this book will shortly be withdrawn from Leanpub due to a publishing deal that is currently under offer, so get it now while you can - it's available right now on Leanpub for the super low price of $19.99!

[Get the book here](https://leanpub.com/intune-DeployPSApps)

You have *nothing* to lose - if you don't feel that the book is of value to you or your organisation, simply use the Leanpub 'no questions asked', 2-clicks  money back guarantee!
