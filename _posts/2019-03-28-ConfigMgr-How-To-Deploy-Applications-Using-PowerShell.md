I have a book out: **ConfigMgr - An Administrator's Guide to Deploying Applications using PowerShell**

This isn't a book on how to create applications within Config Mgr - it's the actual how-to *deployment* of applications \ files etc.  Brilliant stuff!

It's available right now on Leanpub for the super low price of $19.99 - so grab it now!

[Get the book here](https://leanpub.com/configmgr-DeployUsingPS)

You have *nothing* to lose - if you don't feel that the book is of value to you or your organisation, simply use the Leanpub 'no questions asked', 2-clicks  money back guarantee!

**Feb 2020 Update**
As well as LeanPub, it is now available from Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and a host of other places.  Click the following universal link to see where else you can get it: [https://books2read.com/u/b688My](https://books2read.com/u/b688My)
