I'm writing a book!  I have nearly finished my first technical book: 

**ConfigMgr - An Administrator's Guide to Deploying Applications using PowerShell**

This isn't a book on how to create applications within Config Mgr - it's the actual *deployment* of applications \ files etc.  Brilliant stuff!

It's available right now on Leanpub for the super low price of $9.97 - so grab it now!

[Get the book here](https://leanpub.com/configmgr-DeployUsingPS)

You have *nothing* to lose - if you don't feel that the book is of value to you or your organisation, simply use the Leanpub 'no questions asked', 2-clicks  money back guarantee!
