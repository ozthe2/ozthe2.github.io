I'm writing a book!  I have nearly finished my first technical book: 

**ConfigMgr - An Administrator's Guide to Deploying Applications using PowerShell**

This isn't a book on how to create applications within Config Mgr - it's the actual *deployment* of applications \ files etc.  Brilliant stuff!

It's available right now on Leanpub for the super low price of $9.97.  When the book is complete in about two weeks from now the price will go up - so grab it now!

At the time of writing this post it is 56% complete (Parts 1 to 5) - but don't let that put you off as in reality, the next part (Part 6: Deploying the Script) will pretty much finish it off.

The remaining three parts 7, 8 and 9 are more code examples. (Although Part 7 is a fantastic ready to go, re-usable application deployment template that I wrote and use in my deployments.)

You have *nothing* to lose - if you don't feel that the book is of value to you or your organisation, simply use the Leanpub 'no questions asked', 2-clicks  money back guarantee!
