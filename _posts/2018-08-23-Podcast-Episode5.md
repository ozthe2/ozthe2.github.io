It's finally arrived - the next episode that I know you have all been eagerly awaiting!

If you haven't done so already, I recommend [listening to episode 4]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-06-03-Podcast-Episode4.md %}) before this one just so everything is a bit more in context.

In this episode, I continue the discussion on doing a job properly and explain how I have started to achieve this very thing!  Starting with re-factoring an old PowerShell module I wrote, hooking it up to AppVeyor and uploading it to the Microsoft PowerShell Gallery all the way to a complete overhaul of our documentation and ending up with a new IDE !

As usual, you can follow me on Twitter: [@OzThe2](https://twitter.com/ozthe2) and check out anything on My GitHub account: [https://github.com/OzThe2](https://github.com/OzThe2)
