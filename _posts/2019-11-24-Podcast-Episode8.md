Podcast: The Secret Diary of a Network Administrator Episode 8.
In this episode I talk about the continuing voyages of AOVPN, SCCM, AppLocker, my two new SCCM books, and some of the other work I have been up to. I also have a small moan and explain why I dumped Twitter.  

Here are some links to some of the resources that I mention in the podcast:
