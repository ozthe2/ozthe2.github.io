I'm a network admin for a global company specialising in air chartering.

Microsoft Active Directory, PowerShell and ConfigMgr are the tools of my trade whilst the ESP KH-2 NTB, Marshall JCM2000 and various effects pedals are my tools of play.

The bands I really enjoy listening to are Exodus, Slayer, Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth, W.A.S.P, Joe Satriani and Yngwie Malmsteen.
